## Terminal

- Enter `python` in lowercase to enter to the Python interpreter shell.
- Run a snippet of Python code.
- Press `Ctrl-Z`  (`Ctrl-D` for Linux & mac) then `Enter` to close, or enter the command `exit()`.

## Workspace

- Make a folder called *python_work* somewhere for projects.
- It's best to use lowercase letters and underscores for spaces in file and folders names, because Python uses these name conventions.

## Troubleshooting

Check the *traceback* (which is an error report (record) of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute the code).
